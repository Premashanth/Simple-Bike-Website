						var x="<div class='description'><div class='bikeName'>Harley-Davidson:Street 750</div> The Davidson Street 750 was the star two-wheeler at the 2014 Auto Expo where it was officially launched. It holds the distinction of being the first Davidson motorcycle to be manufactured in India and this was the key in its competitive pricing. The cruiser bike has been priced at Rs 4.91 lakh a(ex-showroom, Delhi) and it was recently updated with ABS as many people had complained the lack of it and new colour options. The Street 750 has a classic cruiser styling but unlike most American cruiser motorcycles that are drenched in chrome, the Street 750 adopts an all-black theme. It is a good looking bike but the compact dimension is something that doesn’t appeal many.Harley-Davidson’s latest entry-level machine, the Street 750, has been available on the other side of the Atlantic for a year but now the iconic American brand has bought it across the pond, given it a few upgrades and launched it in Europe.Bike Social was in Barcelona to be among the first to ride it.Priced very accessibly from only £5795 and available in UK dealerships from 18th September, the bike is firmly aimed at a younger audience in a bid to get them engaged with the brand earlier in their motorcycling life. That’s ‘Young and Urban’ in Harley-speak.The bike slots into the Dark Custom range alongside the also newly revised Iron 883 and Forty Eight (both have new styling, wheels and suspension). At the launch, Harley-Davidson’s European PR Manager, Michael Carney, explained the theory behind Dark Custom, “It’s the underground contemporary face of Harley-Davidson, a movement. Don’t just think black, think blank canvas for customisation.”A colourful array of vivid paint, brushed metal, plenty of carbon fibre and aftermarket goodies dressed on a dozen customised Street 750’s and Forty-Eight’s were the Dark Custom evidence surrounding us during the launch presentation. The skills on display were fresh from a European wide customising competition for 150 European Harley dealerships called ‘Battle of the Kings’.   </div><div class='description'>&nbsp</div>"

						var x="<div class='description'><div class='bikeName'>Harley-Davidson:Iron 883</div> Last year, Harley-Davidson updated the Iron 883’s suspension, giving it emulsion shocks and cartridge forks. It made a huge improvement in the ride, and the updated suspension returns for 2017.With the suspension firm, but not harsh, the Iron 883 is happy to make its way through the canyons with an admirable confidence. Although the handling, suspension, braking, and power aren’t up to the Sportster Roadster 1200 specs, the Iron 883 is a nice way to dip a toe into the pool of sporting cruisers—this is a bike with a modest 30 degrees of rake.Thanks to the excellent Michelin Scorcher 31 rubber, the Iron 883 can be taken to the peg feelers with full confidence. For the less aggressive riders, touching down will be rare, even with the limited lean angle (28 degrees on the left, and one degree less on the right).The reason the lean angle isn’t that important is that you don’t throw the Iron 883 around like a lightweight sport bike. Weighing in at the curb at 562 pounds, much of it carried low, the Iron 883 is all about deliberate, confident performance.Rough pavement isn’t as upsetting as you might expect from the skinny 39mm forks and the shocks with just 1.6 inches of rear wheel travel. Harley-Davidson got the damping and springing right—a good thing, as the only adjustment is rear spring preload. As long as you don’t exceed the leeway provided by the suspension—something that’s harder to do than you might expect—the Iron 883 will complete that corner exactly the way you envisioned.Exiting corners, the Iron 883 has that smooth acceleration you expect from a motor with plenty of flywheel. It won’t launch you forward unexpectedly; instead, it builds speed in a consistently satisfying manner. Unless you just can’t stand to shift the well-working five-speed transmission, you will never hit the rev limited, even though the Sportster lacks a rev counter.      </div><div class='description'>&nbsp</div>"

					var x="<div class='description'><div class='bikeName'>Harley-Davidson:Roadster</div> Take a Harley-Davidson Sportster 1200 and strip it to the bone. Add in a whole dose of Fifties and Sixties hot rod, drag-strip flavour, throw in some adjustable rear shocks, a menacing stance, a set of upside down forks and twin discs with ABS and you’ve got the new Harley-Davidson Roadster.This is the Harley-Davidson Sportster Roadster and we’re at the world launch in the South of France to ride the bike from Marseille to St Tropez and back. We haven’t seen a sportier Harley since the XR1200 launched back in 2008, itself a Harley that handled but with way more flat track routes and pretensions than this – the sportiest Sportster yet.Sat behind on the new 1200cc Sportster-based Harley-Davidson Roadster and I’m making the most of its extra ground clearance, longer suspension and jacked-up stance. The way it sits is more aggressive too. The back is lifted up so it sits more on its nose and I'm making the most of that trying to follow Hearn. That means it turns in faster too, and the kind of left-right-left flip-flop corners are proving no problem for the Roadster. It handles like a normal bike rather than a cruiser, and you can feel those fat upside down forks working, feel what the front tyre is doing. The tyres may not be the stickiest, but they’re more than adequate.            </div><div class='description'>&nbsp</div>"

					var x="<div class='description'><div class='bikeName'>Harley-Davidson:Fatboy</div>Hitting the starter, and the Milwaukee-Eight fires up with the customary Harley rumble. It slips into gear nicely too, and the clutch feels lighter than on the 103s as well. But it’s the power delivery that really sets this bike apart from its predecessorsWith the big, fat tyres, it’s not a bike that lends itself to tight, twisty riding. In fact, I found I had to ‘encourage’ it to lean into some corners when first got on board. Its forte is more the boulevards and highways of the world with some nice long sweepers thrown in.It’s comfortable on a run. The seat is built for the larger of us, and it’s well-padded and supportive. I can’t speak for the pillion seat which looks a bit on the small side as my other half didn’t get on. The riding position is comfortable with plenty of room on the footboards to get comfortable and you don’t have to reach for the bars. </div><div class='description'>&nbsp</div>"

					var x="<div class='description'><div class='bikeName'>Harley-Davidson:Fatbob</div> As with the rest of the Softail range, the Fat Bob boasts Harley’s Milwaukee-Eight V-twin. This engine was first seen in the 2017 tourer range, and for the Softails its received dual internal counter-balancing, which works with the rigid engine mounts to reduce vibrations.On all eight Softail models, the 1745cc 107 unit is standard. For an extra £1,200, buyers can specify the 1868cc 114, which makes 92.7hp and 114 lbft of torque. Peak torque is reached at 3,000 revs, while the engine tops out just shy of 6,000.While comfortable, it’s far from the laid-back, relaxing ride associated with Harley-Davidsons. Thanks to wide tyres – 150mm at the front, and 180mm at the rear – the Fat Bob takes a decent shove of counter-steer to lean in to tight bends, and even more so at lower speeds. Mid-corner, the thick front just wants to stand back up. While the styling may mimic sports bikes, the ride certainly does not.Like a man who wears a small T-shirt to accentuate his muscles, Harley has scaled back on tank size to show off the big twin. At 13.6-litres it is one of the smallest in the Softail range. Combined with fuel economy of 44mpg, it won’t make for the best range, but this bike is more about being seen than long-distance touring.  </div><div class='description'>&nbsp</div>"
